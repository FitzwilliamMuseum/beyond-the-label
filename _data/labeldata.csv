1,Panel,Intro,,SENSUAL VIRTUAL,"These two words give the Fitzwilliam its first annual theme, explored throughout the Museum over the next twelve months in exhibitions, displays and events.

They are words containing dilemmas, truly words for now.
In our world, sensual pleasures are increasingly simulated through technological innovations. But how far should we go?

'sensual' embraces all the pleasures our senses give us: the glorious sound of birdsong, the scent of roses, the touch of silk or of another person. Using just one sense, sight, artists encourage us to imagine everything we experience with our other senses.  But does the allure of the sensuous bypass our minds, preventing serious thinking?  Too much sensuality might be dangerous '

'Virtual'. Today, we think of this as something simulated by computer, but imitating the real is as old as art itself. Art became virtual as soon as humans tried to reproduce what they saw and how they experienced the world. The results are copies: images or evocations of the real thing. Do they lack the 'soul' of the original?
By its very artificiality, art creates its own reality, in which the sensual and the virtual are co-dependent. That reality extends and enriches our world. Can the art of the past help us make aesthetic and moral decisions about the place of the sensual and virtual in our art and lives today?

2,Panel,Intro,,The Founder's Building: Gallery 3,"Welcome to the Fitzwilliam Museum.

The Museum is named after Richard, 7th Viscount Fitzwilliam (1745-1816), a graduate of Cambridge University with a passion for collecting. He felt strongly that the University should have its own museum, not only for the display of works of art, but also with its own library. In his will Fitzwilliam he left the princely sum of  '100,000 (around '10,000,000 in today's money) to build an unforgettable monument that would be both a place of learning and one of the most magnificent galleries of its day.

At the centre of the building, designed by the architect George Basevi (1794-1845) and completed by Charles Robert Cockerell (1788-1863), this gallery is widely considered one of the finest museum interiors in the world.
Here, and throughout the museum's galleries, paintings are hung alongside sculpture, furniture, ceramics, manuscripts and coins and medals in a distinctive installation that reflects the richness and diversity of the Fitzwilliam's collections.",,,,,,,https://beyondthelabel.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/images/layouts/founders.jpg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gallery 3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,/images/labels/founders.jpg,g3-then-and-now

13,Label,Object,,,,MS 1-1933 fols. 1v-2r,238722,,Ode to a Nightingale,"Hampstead, May 1819","This manuscript contains the original draft of 'Ode to a Nightingale', the only copy in Keats's own handwriting to survive. The story of its composition is told by Charles Armitage Brown (1787-1842), with whom Keats was living in Wentworth Place, Hampstead in the spring of 1819. Brown's Life of John Keats - first delivered as a lecture at the Plymouth Athenaeum nearly sixteen years after the poet's death and not published until 1937 ' contains the following memorable account:
'I observed that every short poem, which he was tempted to compose, was scrawled on the first piece of paper at hand, and that it was afterwards used a mark to a book, or thrust anywhere aside. In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree, where he sat for two or three hours. When he came into the house, I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feeling on the song of our nightingale. The writing was not well legible; and it was difficult to arrange the stanzas on so many scraps. With his assistance I succeeded and this was his Ode to a Nightingale, a poem which has been the delight of everyone. Immediately afterwards I searched for more of his (in reality) fugitive pieces, in which task, at my request, he again assisted me. Thus I rescued that Ode and other valuable short poems, which might otherwise have been lost. From that day, he gave me permission to copy any verses he might write, and I fully availed myself of it. He cared so little for them himself, when once, as it appeared to me, his imagination was released from their influence, that it required a friend at hand to preserve them.'
Scholars have argued about the reliability of Brown's account, and whether the Fitzwilliam manuscript represents the very first draft or a subsequent reworking. Note that, in line with Brown's narrative, these two pages have been hastily torn from a notebook ' they have damage to edges typical of pages sewn in and subsequently torn out. The order of the stanzas on the pages is also significant. It seems that Keats had grabbed two sheets of paper and began writing on the first page. Working with his customary intense speed and concentration, he did not turn the paper over, but continued on a second sheet. He then ran out of paper, but did not re-enter the house to seek more, but turned instead to the back (verso) of the first sheet, and finally, the verso of the second sheet. These are pages written in the full flood of concentrated inspiration ' Keats did not know as he wrote how long the poem was going to be or what the end point was. In other words, they have all the hallmarks of a very first draft.
The text was first published first published anonymously in July 1819 in Annals of the Fine Arts, a short-lived periodical. It was published again with a few changes the following year the collection of Keats's work, Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St Agnes and other Poems (London: Taylor and Hessey, 1820). Keats death followed soon after in February 1821.",http://www-img.fitzmuseum.cam.ac.uk/img/msspb/msspb20/ms 1-1933_f1r_201302_amt49_dc1.jpg,6,Manuscripts and Printed Books,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Gallery 3,John Keats ,1795-1795,Autograph manuscript,"Given by the 1st Marquess of Crewe, 1933",SENSUAL/VIRTUAL ,,,,,,,,,,/images/labels/ms 1-1933_f1r_201302_amt49_dc1.jpg,nightingale
