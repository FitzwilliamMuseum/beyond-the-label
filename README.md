# Beyond the Label- Fitzwilliam Museum

This repository will hold code for the Beyond the Label project. This project
contains data pulled from AdLib, curatorial interpretation, video and audio content and additional materials. It is written in Jekyll, hosted on GH-Pages and is an experimental piece.

The museum's visitors will be invited to visit the pages on this site by access methods in gallery such as:
